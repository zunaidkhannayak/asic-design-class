Lab 1_Task1: to make 
C program and compile it using gcc compiler. Verify the output of the C program after execution.

Lab 1_task2:

The same c program was compiled using this command with riscv compiler:

`riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1tot.o sum1ton.c`

After that the following command was used to dump the assembly code in the terminal:

`riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1to1.o | less`

Task-3
 To Execute  the object file created by the RISC-V GCC compiler by use of Spike-Simulator.
 
for executing an object file created by the RISC-V GCC compiler we use the following command:
spike pk sum1ton.o
"pk" means proxy kernel.
The proxy kernel(pk) is a lightweight runtime environment for RISC-V programs, acting as a minimal operating system that provides essential services like system calls.
It helps to bridge the gap between simulator and application.

Now debug using spike simulator
To debug the assembly code generated in the object file in using the spike.
we use following command:
spike -d pk sum1ton.c

Now to jump to begining of the "main" section we  use following command:
until sp 0 0x100b0

for checking value of any register we use following command:
reg 0 a0,
To execute the current instruction pointed by 'sp' and to appear on the next instruction, "Enter" button can be pressed to go to next instruction.
